### Candlestick

The colour of the candle stick matters for `Open` and `Close`

<img src="images/candlestick.png" alt="Cover Image" height="250" width="250" />

1. Bullish Candle (usually green), Close > Open
2. Bearish Candle (usually red), Close < Open

For `high` and `low`, it doesn't matter.

E.g. Let's say you set the chart to `daily` for a specific stock.

High = This is the top of the candle wick.
This is the highest fill price for a specific stock on that day.

Open = This is the top bar of the candle. (Red or green?)
This tells you the fill price of the first trade of the stock on that day 

Close = This is bottom bar of the candle. (Red or green?)
This tells you the fill price of the last trade of the stock on that day 

Low = This is the bottom of the candle wick.
This is the lowest fill price for a specific stock on that day.

### Candlestick volume

At the bottom of the Candlestick (below the `Low`) there will be bar chart.

Note: This is for the platform `TradingView`

Each bar is the volume of the specific candle above.

The volume is `the total number of shares` of that stock 
that were traded on that specific day.

If the time period is set to 15 minutes and you however over the volume,
bar and it says: `Wed 02 May '25 03:45` then that is volume bar is showing
the volume between `04:45 and 05:00`
